# BinarySearchTree
The main goal is to have a repository for practicing and testing on the Binary Search Tree data structure using Java.

The Binary Search Tree (unbalanced) allows the user to see the root to its respective child nodes. 
If the node happens to be the root then the root would appear as '0'.

Basic operations such as add(value), remove(value), and height() are provided to the user and executed when invoked.
